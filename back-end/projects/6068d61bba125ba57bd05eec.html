            Scream Machine
        </h1>
        <p>
            While still in the works, this machine will be used to prank some of our friends. It will be built using a Raspberry Pi. Here is how it works.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                We will prepare it by typing the wifi name and password into a simple text file.
            </li>
            <li>
                After placed and plugged in, the Raspberry Pi will boot up and begin the scripts.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first script, programed in Python, will identify the wifi network provided and connect to it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second script, a Node.js server, will serve a website onto the internet.
            </li>
            <li>
                After ensuring everything is working, the server will send an API call to my computer. This API call will provide the website to connect to.
            </li>
            <li>
                After accessing the website, we will click the <em>Initiate Scream</em> button, and the speaker will scream.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
            Current Progress:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The screaming script works. It serves a webpage and can be initiated by a seperate device visiting the webpage. It remains to develop the Python script.
