            This small web application accepts either a Roman or Arabic Numeral and converts it to the other. It is
            built
            using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I decided not to use a framework such as Vue or Angular because the
            manipluation of the HTML DOM is quite minor. You can access it <a href="#">here</a>.

        </h3>
        <p>
            The algoritm to convert Arabic to Roman numerals is quite simple actually. The code first checks for basic
            error
            cases, such as letters or floating point numbers (decimals). Then a loop begins which compares the Arabic
            numerals magnitude to the values denoted by various combinations of Roman Numerals, such as IV = 4, L = 50.
            Checking first for the combinations of greatest value, if the number is larger than one of the Roman Numeral
            combinations, the equilvilant roman numeral is appended to a string and its value subtracted from the value
            of
            the Arabic Numeral. This process continues until the Arabic Numeral is equal to 0, the loop finishes, and
            the
            string of Roman Numerals is returned.

            Roman to Arabic
        </h3>
        <p>
            Coverting Roman Numerals to Arabic Numerals required me to develop a much more complex algorithm. It
            utilizes
            multiple internal functions: one of which converts single Roman Numerals to their Arabic Numeral equivilant
            and
            the other determines which Roman Numerals can precede each other. This second function is necessary because
            Roman Numerals denote numbers like 4 as IV instead of IIII. The Roman Numeral is stored as a string value.
            The
            program parses through the numeral character by character. In most cases the value of the character is added
            to
            a variable denoting the running sum; however, when the character following the character being parsed
            represents
            a value greater than it. When this is the case the program determines whether the characters are in a valid
            order and then subtracts the value of one from the other. This new value is added to the running sum. This
            process is completed until the entire Roman Numeral String is parsed. The running sum is then returned.

            My thoughts
        </h2>
        <p>
            Overall the project was very fun. I implimented a lot of error catching. I then used the errors that were
            thrown
            to display to the user the problem. This was my first time really utilizing throw statements, and I feel I
            leveraged their power very well.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Going forward
        </h2>
        <p>
            The code I wrote to convert Arabic to Roman numerals is quite clean. While I think that I could marginally
            speed
            up this algorithm, it would lose its generality.
        </p>
        <p>
            I really want to revisit the algorithm that converts Roman to Arabic numerals. I think that is is well
            coded,
            but by reworking the logic, the algorithm could become a lot cleaner.
