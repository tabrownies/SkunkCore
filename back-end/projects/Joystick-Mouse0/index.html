            About
        </h2>
        <p>
            This joystick can be used as a mouse for any computer. It is built from raw materials: cardboard, two
            screw-on
            bottle caps, and old dowel, a bouncey ball, and some circuit boards. It's constuction too only required
            basic
            tools: scisors, soldering iron, and a hot glue gun.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the most impressive thing about the joystick is the melding of various, second-hand materials into
            the
            final product. For example, the dowel is succured by the cap to a chocolate milk jug. This give it free
            range of
            tilting
            motion while restricting translating motion. Similarly, the object attached to the dowel to trigger the
            buttons
            is the top of a water bottle. These bottle caps, as well as the cardboard, forced me to return to our
            families
            recycling bin frequently. Speaking of which, nothing but the circut boards are brand new. I reused many old
            broken things which were lying around the house to construct this joystick.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How it works
        </h2>
        <p>
            At the basic level, the joystick, right-click, and left-click are simply six individual buttons connected to
            a
            microcontroler, in this case an Arduino Yun. To ensure accurate readings of the buttons values a 270 ohm
            pull
            down resister is added to each button's circutry. After reading the current (or absence of) coming from each
            of
            the buttons, the Arduino microcontroler determines what commands to send to the computer to move the mouse.
            The
            mouse moving commands are all prepackaged with the Arduino software. These commands only work on a handful
            of
            Arduinos, hence the use of the Arduino Yun, despite the Yun's much grander abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The buttons are positioned vertically around the dowel which makes up the joystick. As this dowel is moved
            back
            and forth, a bottle cap on the end presses these vertically oriented buttons. If the right button is
            pressed,
            the bottom of the dowel has been pushed right, meaning the top has been pushed left, and the microcontroler
            send
            the "Move Left" command to the computer. Similarly the other buttons are programmed to move the cursor
            oposite
            of the direcion they face.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How the Joystick and Enclosure were Built
        </h2>
        <p>
            The joystick is, at the core, an old dowel with a punctured bouncey ball stuck to the end for the user to
            hold. It is placed through a punctured milk carton cap. As mentioned above this cap allows the dowel to
            tilt, but not translate. Hot glue is added, which secures it in place. Below the milk lid, a water bottle
            lid is also attached via hot glue and a through-hole. This is a much more rigid connection and is what
            physically presses the buttons. The buttons are soldered to strips of perfboard, which are secured vertically by
            hot-glue in slits
            near the base of the joystick, positioned so that the bottle lid presses them. This is all glued to a thin piece of cardboard, which is in turn ducttaped to
            the bigger enclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The strips of perfboard's wires are soldered into another perfboard containing the circuit, consisting of four identical cucuits shown below.
        </p>
        <img class="schematic-image" src="/api/projects/pages/Joystick-Mouse0/buttonSchematic.png">
        <p>
            The left- and right-click buttons mirror the circut above, but electrically are not routed through the same perfboard. Although that would have been more efficient those buttons were more of an afterthought.

            How to Build
        </h2>
        <h2>
            Going Forward
        </h2>
        <p>
            This build was inspired by a Lego Mindstorms creation I saw years ago on the now discontinued NXTLog. The
            creator had made a number of these joysticks, each iteration introducing upgrades from the last. Using what
            I
            remembered about his designed I constucted my joystick. Like him (or her), going forward I intend to
            continue
            to
            improve on the design.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The next iteration will (hopefully) have a wooden container which will secure the joystick, buttons,
                    microcontroler, and ciruitboards. It will
                    be
                    sturdier and use nicer buttons. As another feature it will also have a switch to activate different
                    modes the joystick will be able to operate in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After that I will use a 3D printed enclosure which will allow me to add more buttons around the
                    dowel for greater accuracey.
                    With this iteration I intend to introduce a lot more features to the joytick. It will be pressable
                    for a
                    normal left click and also spin for scrolling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The final verson will have analog sensors to gain extremely accurate measurements of the
                    joystick's tilt.
                </li>
            </ol>
